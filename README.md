# Calculator-Application-with-Network-Logging-in-C

Overview
This repository contains two C programs that demonstrate a simple client-server interaction using TCP sockets. The client program connects to the server, exchanges data (two integers and a choice of operation), and receives the result, time taken, and size of the response from the server.

Files
client.c: The client-side code that connects to a server, sends data, and receives responses.
server.c: The server-side code that listens for incoming client connections, processes data, and sends responses back to the client.
Prerequisites
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for compiling the C programs.
Basic knowledge of C programming and socket programming.
Compilation
To compile the client and server programs, use the following commands:
